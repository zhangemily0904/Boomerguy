For this project, I created a 2D strategic tile-based game called "Boomerguy." 
The objective of this game is to kill all opponents by dropping bombs near them. 
During the game, player(s) can increase the chance of winning by collecting power-ups.

The game supports both single player mode and local multiplayer mode. In both mode,
player(s) can input their names and will have the option to build their own maps 
or use a randomly generated map. 

For the single player mode, the player will play against a computer AI that uses
the Astar tracking algorithm to generate the shortest path to get to the player.

For the multiplayer mode, players can set their own keys for each player and will 
play against each other. The player that survives till the end wins.
